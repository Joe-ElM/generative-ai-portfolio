    "# HomeMatch: Personalized Real Estate Finder\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of my complete HomeMatch project, which is designed to create a personalized real estate listing experience. The application uses large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and dynamic user inputs to recommend property listings tailored to user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can input specific features such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, and desired amenities. The system semantically searches a database of generated real estate listings and personalizes the descriptions to match the user's profile, making the search experience engaging and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployed Live Application\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this notebook, I have developed and deployed a fully working live version of this project on Hugging Face Spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can access the deployed application here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ **[Live HomeMatch App on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Joe-ElM/HomeMatch)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct link (copyable):  \n",
    "https://huggingface.co/spaces/Joe-ElM/HomeMatch\n",
    "\n",
    "This live version allows users to interact with the model via a user-friendly interface and see the personalized property listings generated in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect user preferences through natural language input.\n",
    "- Generate and personalize property listings using an LLM.\n",
    "- Use vector similarity search to match user preferences with available properties.\n",
    "- Present personalized, engaging property descriptions to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- LangChain\n",
    "- FAISS (Vector Search)\n",
    "- OpenAI API (LLM and embeddings)\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Gradio (Interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate a set of synthetic property listings using LLM.\n",
    "- Embed property descriptions into vector space for similarity search.\n",
    "- Collect buyer preferences via natural language input.\n",
    "- Perform semantic search to retrieve the most relevant properties.\n",
    "- Personalize the retrieved property descriptions to highlight buyer preferences.\n",
    "- Present results in a user-friendly web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this notebook complements the live application and demonstrates the core components of the system such as:\n",
    "- Listing generation\n",
    "- Vector store preparation\n",
    "- User profile creation\n",
    "- Semantic search\n",
    "- Personalized output generation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the full experience, I invite you to try the deployed application using the link above.\n"
